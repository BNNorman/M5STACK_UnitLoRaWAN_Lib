I bought one of these to play with then went looking for a library, which would give me full control over the device, but was unable to find one. There are examples to connect to TTN alright but they were all very basic. Most were C but, since the device handles the LoRaWAN stack for you I chose to use Python.

Anyway, the library is in the final stages of testing and will be uploaded here as soon as I can.
